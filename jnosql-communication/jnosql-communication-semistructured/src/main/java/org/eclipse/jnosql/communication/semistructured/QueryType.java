/**
 * Enum representing the different types of queries supported in Jakarta Data.
 *
 * <p>The {@code QueryType} enum categorizes queries into three main types: {@code SELECT},
 * {@code DELETE}, and {@code UPDATE}. These types correspond to the standard operations
 * typically executed against a database. This enum is used to interpret and classify
 * queries within the Jakarta Data API, particularly in implementations like Eclipse JNoSQL.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #SELECT} - Represents a query that retrieves data from the database.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #DELETE} - Represents a query that removes data from the database.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #UPDATE} - Represents a query that modifies existing data in the database.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #parse(String)} method is provided to determine the type of a given query
 * string by extracting and evaluating its command keyword. The method returns a corresponding
 * {@code QueryType} based on the first six characters of the query, assuming that the query
 * begins with a standard SQL-like command.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that if the query string does not contain a recognizable command (e.g., if it is
 * shorter than six characters or does not match any known command), the method defaults to
 * {@code SELECT}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This enum is particularly relevant for NoSQL implementations like Eclipse JNoSQL, where
 * the query language might differ from traditional SQL, yet still, adhere to the concepts
 * of selection, deletion, and updating of data.</p>
